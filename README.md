I am building this site as a part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form)
as directed by The Odin Project. Hopefully this will cement the theory I have 
learned about forms and different input types by putting it into practice. It
will also be good to further practice the basics of CSS with containers and 
responsive formatting.
